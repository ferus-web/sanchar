# ferus-sanchar v2: a rewrite of the original ferus-sanchar library
This time around, the library has been mostly rewritten with a cleaner API in mind. \
It has no dependencies other than the Nim standard library, granted that `nph` is only used as a code formatter and `drchaos` is used to fuzz the URL parser.
